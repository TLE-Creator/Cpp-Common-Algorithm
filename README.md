# Algorithm

1. **DSU (Disjoint Set Union)** - with path compression.

2. **Kruskal's Algorithm** - for finding the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.

3. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm** - for finding shortest paths in a weighted graph with positive or negative edge weights (but no negative cycles).

4. **The Struct if Edge** - a simple structure to represent an edge in a graph.

5. **Binary Search** - an efficient algorithm for finding an item from a sorted list of items.
